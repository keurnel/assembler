# Keurnel - Assembler

Keurnel Assembler (kasm) is the assembler used by Keurnel to convert Keurnel Assembly code into machine code that can be
executed on the target architecture.

### Why a custom assembler?

As keurnel we want to have full control over our software, using a custom assembler allows us to operate independently
of tools created outside the European Union. Software written outside the EU may be subjected to export controls,
sanctions or other legal restrictions that could limit our ability to use or distribute it.

By developing our own assembler, we can ensure that it is compliant with EU regulations and can be freely used and
distributed within the EU without any legal concerns. Additionally, having our own assembler allows us to tailor it
specifically to the needs of Keurnel, optimizing it for our target architectures and ensuring that it integrates
seamlessly with our build system.
